blueprint:
  name: Relative Attic Fan Control
  description: >
    Run an attic fan based on the difference between the attic and outside temperatures.
    The fan turns on when the attic is above a minimum temperature and the temperature delta 
    (attic - outside) exceeds a user-set threshold, and turns off once a target low attic temperature is reached.
