  description: >
    Attic Fan Control v2.0 – This blueprint controls an attic fan relative to the attic and outside temperatures.
    The fan turns on when the attic temperature is above a target and the difference (attic minus outside)
    exceeds a threshold, and turns off when the attic cools below the target or when the stop time is reached.
    A cooldown period prevents rapid cycling and a manual override is available.
