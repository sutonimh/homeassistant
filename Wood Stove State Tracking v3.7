  name: "Wood Stove State Tracking v3.7"
  description: >
    Tracks the state of a wood stove based on a thermocouple temperature sensor,
    enforcing sequential state transitions. In addition to the original transitions,
    if the stove is in the "Warming Up" state and the temperature drops below the 
    "Warming Up Setpoint" (i.e. the fire never reaches the "Burning" threshold), it 
    will transition to "Cooling."
