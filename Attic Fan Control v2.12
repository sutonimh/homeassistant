  description: >
    Attic Fan Control v2.12 – Run an attic fan based on the difference between the attic and outside temperatures.
    The fan turns on when the attic temperature is above a target temperature and the temperature delta
    (attic - outside) exceeds a user-set threshold, and turns off once the attic cools to or below the target.
    Additionally, if the fan is running when the stop time is reached, it is automatically turned off.
    This automation respects a cooldown period and can be manually overridden.
